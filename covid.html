        <h2>IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT CLASSES DURING COVID</h2>

        <h3>
        </h3>
        <p>
            We are back to normal and changing partners during classes as it improves everyone's dance technique by dancing with other people.
        </p>
        
        <h3>
        </h3>
        
        <p>
            However as each individual has a different personal circumstance, not everyone will want to change partners or dance with anyone else other than their partner yet. So we can respect that decision and not get upset if anyone declines a dance.
